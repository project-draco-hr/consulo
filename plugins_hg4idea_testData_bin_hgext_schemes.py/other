'extend schemes with shortcuts to repository swarms\n\nThis extension allows you to specify shortcuts for parent URLs with a\nlot of repositories to act like a scheme, for example::\n\n  [schemes]\n  py = http://code.python.org/hg/\n\nAfter that you can use it like::\n\n  hg clone py://trunk/\n\nAdditionally there is support for some more complex schemas, for\nexample used by Google Code::\n\n  [schemes]\n  gcode = http://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/\n\nThe syntax is taken from Mercurial templates, and you have unlimited\nnumber of variables, starting with ``{1}`` and continuing with\n``{2}``, ``{3}`` and so on. This variables will receive parts of URL\nsupplied, split by ``/``. Anything not specified as ``{part}`` will be\njust appended to an URL.\n\nFor convenience, the extension adds these schemes by default::\n\n  [schemes]\n  py = http://hg.python.org/\n  bb = https://bitbucket.org/\n  bb+ssh = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/\n  gcode = https://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/\n  kiln = https://{1}.kilnhg.com/Repo/\n\nYou can override a predefined scheme by defining a new scheme with the\nsame name.\n'
