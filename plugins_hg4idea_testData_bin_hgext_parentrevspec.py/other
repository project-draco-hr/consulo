'interpret suffixes to refer to ancestor revisions\n\nThis extension allows you to use git-style suffixes to refer to the\nancestors of a specific revision.\n\nFor example, if you can refer to a revision as "foo", then::\n\n  foo^N = Nth parent of foo\n  foo^0 = foo\n  foo^1 = first parent of foo\n  foo^2 = second parent of foo\n  foo^  = foo^1\n\n  foo~N = Nth first grandparent of foo\n  foo~0 = foo\n  foo~1 = foo^1 = foo^ = first parent of foo\n  foo~2 = foo^1^1 = foo^^ = first parent of first parent of foo\n'
