"track a line of development with movable markers\n\nBookmarks are local movable markers to changesets. Every bookmark\npoints to a changeset identified by its hash. If you commit a\nchangeset that is based on a changeset that has a bookmark on it, the\nbookmark shifts to the new changeset.\n\nIt is possible to use bookmark names in every revision lookup (e.g. hg\nmerge, hg update).\n\nBy default, when several bookmarks point to the same changeset, they\nwill all move forward together. It is possible to obtain a more\ngit-like experience by adding the following configuration option to\nyour .hgrc::\n\n  [bookmarks]\n  track.current = True\n\nThis will cause Mercurial to track the bookmark that you are currently\nusing, and only update it. This is similar to git's approach to\nbranching.\n"
