"show progress bars for some actions\n\nThis extension uses the progress information logged by hg commands\nto draw progress bars that are as informative as possible. Some progress\nbars only offer indeterminate information, while others have a definite\nend point.\n\nThe following settings are available::\n\n  [progress]\n  delay = 3 # number of seconds (float) before showing the progress bar\n  refresh = 0.1 # time in seconds between refreshes of the progress bar\n  format = topic bar number # format of the progress bar\n  width = <none> # if set, the maximum width of the progress information\n                 # (that is, min(width, term width) will be used)\n  clear-complete = True # clear the progress bar after it's done\n  disable = False # if true, don't show a progress bar\n  assume-tty = False # if true, ALWAYS show a progress bar, unless\n                     # disable is given\n\nValid entries for the format field are topic, bar, number, unit, and\nitem. item defaults to the last 20 characters of the item, but this\ncan be changed by adding either ``-<num>`` which would take the last\nnum characters, or ``+<num>`` for the first num characters.\n"
