def rollback(ui, repo):
    'roll back the last transaction\n\n    This command should be used with care. There is only one level of\n    rollback, and there is no way to undo a rollback. It will also\n    restore the dirstate at the time of the last transaction, losing\n    any dirstate changes since that time. This command does not alter\n    the working directory.\n\n    Transactions are used to encapsulate the effects of all commands\n    that create new changesets or propagate existing changesets into a\n    repository. For example, the following commands are transactional,\n    and their effects can be rolled back:\n\n    - commit\n    - import\n    - pull\n    - push (with this repository as the destination)\n    - unbundle\n\n    This command is not intended for use on public repositories. Once\n    changes are visible for pull by other users, rolling a transaction\n    back locally is ineffective (someone else may already have pulled\n    the changes). Furthermore, a race is possible with readers of the\n    repository; for example an in-progress pull from the repository\n    may fail if a rollback is performed.\n    '
